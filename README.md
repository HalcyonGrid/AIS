AISv3 user inventory REST API implementation.

See [AIS v3 Interface Spec](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Inventory_API_v3) for the API definition.

Currently this targets a .NET 4.6.1 runtime environment, due to dependencies on older and third-party assemblies.

WORK IN PROGRESS: Just a .NET REST API wrapper so far. Hooking up the InWorldz Cassandra support and filling in functionality.
